Shelley's "Ozymandias" is a sonnet, written in loose iambic pentameter, but with an atypical rhyme scheme[20] (ABABACDC EDEFEF) which violates the rule that there should be no connection in rhyme between the octave and the sestet.

Two themes of the "Ozymandias" poems are the inevitable decline of rulers and their pretensions to greatness.[21]

The rhyme scheme reflects the interlocking stories of poem's four narrative voices, which are its "I", the "traveller" (an exemplar of the sort of travel literature author whose works Shelley would have encountered), the statue's "architect", and the statue's subject himself.[22] The "I met a traveller who [â€¦]" framing of the poem is an instance of the "once upon a time" storytelling device.[20]

Scholars such as professors Nora Crook and Newman White have viewed the work as critical of Shelley's contemporaries George IV, with the statue's legs a coded reference to the then Prince Regent's gout and possible sexually-transmitted diseases, and Napoleon Bonaparte.[23][24] That the poem is connected to Napoleon is indeed the 21st century accepted reading.[25]

Byron scholar Peter Cochran asserted the poem to be "a lesson to tyrants", listing Napeoleon, George IV, Metternich, Tsar Alexander, Emperor Francis, and Castlereagh.[26][27] Jalal Uddin Khan connects it, in addition, to Muammar Gaddafi's statement that he was Africa's "king of kings".[28] That it connects in people's minds to rulers who post-date Shelley is illustrated by incidents such as the one CNN journalist who reported the aerial bombing of Iraq in 1991 signing off the report with the final three lines of the poem.[26]

Other real historic persons to have referred to themselves in such terms include Ashurbanipal who had "I am a hero; I am gigantic; I am colossal; I am magnificent." carved in stone, and Menli I Giray who styled himself "Sovereign of Two Continents and Khan of Khans of the Two Seas".[29]

The tragic fall of powerful men is a theme common in literature, from Giovanni Boccaccio's De Casibus Virorum Illustrium through John Lydgate's The Fall of Princes to Geoffrey Chaucer's The Monk's Tale.[30] Modern scholarship is that Byron's Childe Harold Canto 3, which was about the fall of Napoleon and whose manuscript Shelley had himself transported to Byron's publisher John Murray, was also a prompt for the poem.[31]

Like Samuel Taylor Coleridge's Kubla Khan and Shelley's own Alastor, the poem can be viewed in the context of a wave of Orientalism prevalent in Western Europe, helped along by such events as Napoleon's invasion of Egypt in 1798 and the accompanying Description of Egypt.[32] The imagery of the statue's harsh but commanding bearing is evocative of the Byronic hero, and professor Hadley J. Mozer has gone further in suggesting that Shelley was describing Byron's own 1814 portrait by George Henry Harlow.[33][34]
